# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to get the number of people who are retiring so that the company can be prepared. 
We need to sort these employees into a table and get their titles so that we know which positions need to be filled. Then we are going to get the employees who are eligible to be a mentor.

# Results.

After our analysis we can conclude that the employees who are retiring are:

- 29414 Senior Engineers 
- 28254 Senior staff
- 14222 Engineers
- 12243 from staff
- 4502 Technique Leaders
- 1761 Assistant Engineers
- 2 Managers

And 1549 Qualify for a Mentorship program

# Summary.

90,398 employees are retiring in the "silver tsunami" that's a little more than 30% of the employees this is a huge hit to the company and they need to be as prepared as possible. 

As we mention only 1549 employees are eligible for mentorship. Is very necessary to make a plan for every mentor so that they can mentor as many candidates as possible, something that we need to know is how many mentors are in every department so we would need a new query for that. And that way we would be able to make a better plan.
